# People Counting System (PCS)

## Abstract:

We are planning to develop a machine that counts the number of people in a room. This can be useful to comply with any regulations on the number of participants at, e.g. in the context of infection control laws.


## Approach:

Our objectives are achieved by placing sensors at the entrance of the room. These sensors can register whether a person enters or leaves the room. The data is collected, stored and processed by a *Raspberry Pi*. The *Pi* also controls the output of the display and the optional light signalling system.
